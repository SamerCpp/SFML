# SFML
A C++ application built with SFML that demonstrates basic game mechanics and physics.  The project features a movable square with acceleration and deceleration, smooth movement control, and collision detection.  When a collision occurs, a sound effect is played and the square changes its color, providing visual and audio feedback.
